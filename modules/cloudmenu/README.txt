/**
 * Cloud Menu for Drupal
 * README.txt
 */

Cloud Menu is a module that provides a beautiful, Flash-based 3D tag cloud implementation. It is based on http://drupal.org/project/cumulus
That in turn is based on Roy Tanck's WordPress module called WP-Cumulus (see http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cumulus/)


/**
 * Installing (VERY IMPORTANT!)
 */

- After you put cloud menu in your sites/all/modules or sites/default/modules (or where ever you put them :-) you need one more file...
- That file is cumulus.js (which can't be put on drupal.org since its not licensed under GPL v2.)
- Get that file from http://pratul.in/files/cumulus.js or http://pratulkalia.googlepages.com/cumulus.js
- Put it in your Cloud Menu folder.
- That's it!
